In an age where the discussion of human rights has transcended simply protecting people’s lives, it is important that we discuss issues such as Anti-Discrimination Education and Freedom of Expression on the Internet in the Human Rights Council.

As the line between our ‘real lives’ and our ‘digital lives’ becomes increasingly blurred, we are becoming more and more aware of how our civil and legal rights are translated and transferred into the digital and online world. Freedom of expression and freedom of speech have been issues in our ‘real world’ for centuries. But is the internet any different? Should people have different rights when it comes to expressing their views over Snapchat and Instagram as opposed to in an assembly in front of 500 people?

The second issue being debated is that of Anti-Discrimination Education. We have all – or at least, should have all – been taught that discrimination and racism are wrong. Yet, as our world changes and as consensus over certain issues (often rightfully) changes, how do we teach the next generation to remain, as we all should be, respectful and tolerant? Anti-discrimination or anti-racism education is certainly one approach.

I am sure that each member state in our council will have their own view on the above matters and I look forward to a day of fun (and respectful!) debate. —  Oli :)
