# The Issue of Drones in Afghan Airspace
After the USA agreed to peace with the Taliban and agreed to withdraw forces from Afghanistan, the issue of drones in Afghan airspace has been an ongoing issue, with the US wishing to monitor and target anti-western terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and so called Islamic state within Afghanistan. There have been terrorist attacks in Afghanistan from Isis-K, the afghan branch of so called Islamic State, so there is potential for common work against the terrorist group. However, US drone presence has proved provocative in Afghanistan, with the USA assisinating an Afghan aid worker with a drone , mistakenly thinking that he was a terrorist. This is not the first time US used air-based weaponry on innocents in the region, with US plains bombing a hospital In Kunduz on October 3rd, 2015.

Drones, also referred to as UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) are planes used to target and attack certain people or locations in warfare without having to risk any personnel, and have been used frequently by the USA in recent wars it has been involved with. It is worth noting that according to the BIJ, 22% of all casualties from drone strikes are civilians, and according to numbers from 2014, the USA has approximately 10,000 UAVs in its arsenal.

This in undoubtedly a multifaceted issue which brings up many questions and alternating interests, with common interests to combat terrorist organisations in Afghanistan, but disputes over Afghan autonomy, US strategic interests and the legitimacy of the Taliban make this debate a decisive issue. Further debate over the ethics of the use of UAVs is also something that should be considered for this debate, as well as if foreign powers have the mandate to attack terrorist cells in foreign countries.

## Points to Consider

- What your country's policy on UAVs is

- Your country's involvement in Afghanistan.

- Your country's relationship with the USA, exiled Afghan government and the Taliban.

- Does the foreign nations have the rights to attack terrorist groups in Afghanistan through drone strikes?

- Does the Taliban have Jurisdiction over Afghan airspace?

- What agreements, which all sides would agree too, can be reached?
