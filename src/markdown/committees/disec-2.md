# The Issue of Drones in Afghan Airspace
After the US confirmed the withdrawal of their forces from Afghanistan - effectively ceding the territory to the Taliban militant group - the issue of drones in Afghan airspace has been an ongoing issue. Indeed, the US wishes to monitor and target anti-western terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic state within Afghanistan (ISIS-K), despite its withdrawal of ground forces. There have been terrorist attacks within Afghanistan itself from ISIS-K, so there is potential for common work against the terrorist group with the new Taliban Administration. However, continued US drone presence has proved controversial in Afghanistan, with the US initiating the killing of an Afghan aid worker with a drone, under the mistaken impression that he was a terrorist. This is not the first time the US has deployed air-based weaponry against civilians in the region, with US aircraft responsible for the bombing of a hospital in Kunduz on October 3rd, 2015.

Drones - also referred to as UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) - are aircraft used to target and attack individuals, groups or locations during warfare without risk to any service personnel, and have been used frequently by the US during recent conflicts. It is worth noting that according to the Bureau of Independent Journalism (BIJ), 22% of all casualties from drone strikes are civilians, and, according to statistics dating from 2014, the US maintains approximately 10,000 UAVs in its arsenal.

This in undoubtedly a multifaceted issue which brings up many questions and often-conflicting interests, with common interests to combat terrorist organisations in Afghanistan juxtaposed with disputes over Afghan autonomy, US strategic interests and the legitimacy of the Taliban, meaning this debate is key to regional - and global - security. Further thought on the ethics of the use of UAVs is also something that should be considered for this debate, as well as the question of whether member states have the mandate to attack terrorist cells in foreign countries.

## Points to Consider

- What your country's policy on UAVs is.

- The extent of your country's involvement in Afghanistan.

- Your country's relationship with the USA, the exiled democratic Afghan government and the Taliban militancy.

- Do member states (primarily the US) have the right to attack terrorist groups in Afghanistan through drone strikes?

- Does the Taliban have jurisdiction over Afghan airspace? Should this be recognised internationally and by the UN?

- Can any agreement, palpable to all sides, be reached?
