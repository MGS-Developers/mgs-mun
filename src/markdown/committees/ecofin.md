This year at MGSMUN we are excited to hold an Economics and Finance Committee. Issues of an economic nature are perpetually significant, dictating the quality of life of many globally. As a result we hope that these issues will prove to be topics of great interest to all.

The two issues that will be debated are quite different in nature, yet solutions to both have the potential to ameliorate the living conditions of millions globally. The issue of Economic Recovery Post-COVID, is evidently relevant to our current world; solutions that can minimise the economic contraction and hardship experienced as a result of a pandemic are currently being sought by all nations. The multifaceted nature of this issue should provide a broad scope for research and proposed policies given the pandemic’s impact on employment, economic growth and inequality among others.

The second issue regarding Global Pensions and Old-Age Income Poverty addresses the condition of all in the latter stages of their life. While perhaps not currently pertinent to our age group, a pension will likely be the most important fund to which a majority of us will contribute in our lifetime, dictating standards of living in the later years of life. Additionally, pension reform has the potential to lift many of the world’s elderly population out of relative and/or absolute poverty.

We strongly encourage you to do, at minimum, basic research on the issues and your country’s view on the matter. Submitting a resolution is a great way to demonstrate your knowledge and creativity when addressing these challenging issues. Even if your resolution is not chosen to be debated, we will have reviewed and considered it when deciding who will receive awards. Whether you are an experienced or newer delegate, we hope that you will enjoy our conference and look forward to welcoming you all on the 11th December.
