# The Issue of the Effect of Climate Change on Poor Communities
As the climate crisis increases in severity, it is the poorest communities worldwide who are perhaps most vulnerable to the consequences of such. With the growth of arid areas, particularly in light of increased desertification, as well as the increase of heavy rainfall and flash floods, not to mention of course, rising sea levels, many parts of the earth will simply become uninhabitable if action is not taken.

This issue deals less with how we can mitigate climate change, but instead focuses on how we can adapt to its effects to help the most disadvantaged in society. For example, how can we ensure that the poorest in society have adequate access to food and water where the local climate is putting increasing pressure on the availability of these resources? This is particularly relevant in the Sahel region of Sub-Saharan Africa, where desertification is making farming completely impossible in certain areas, thus creating food shortages.

An important point to consider is that of climate refugees, in particular: those fleeing their communities to evade the issues brought on by climate change such as flash flooding. An estimated 143 million climate refugees will be fleeing their home countries to escape the disastrous impacts of climate change. What will the UN do about the remaining people in poor communities, who, for example, might not have the financial means to move away from their current communities. The issue is about finding effective ways to accommodate people living in these areas so that their human rights are not compromised.

If we do not tackle the issue of food shortages, widespread conflict could break out in the race to access the potentially scarce resource. It is your job to try and combat this issue along with the various issues not mentioned in this briefing paper, of which there is a multitude.

From the UN website: Families living in poverty systematically occupy the least desirable land to damage from climate hazards, such as mud slides, periods of abnormally hot water, water contamination and flooding. Climate change has the potential to worsen their situation and thereby worsen pre-existent inequalities.

## Points to Consider:

- What will be the worst effects of climate change on poor communities?

- How can we deal with the climate refugee crisis?

- How can we accommodate people who are financially “trapped” in areas most susceptible to the effects of the crisis

- What are the most effective ways of ensuring our adaption to climate change is sustainable?

- Consider the difference in immediate ways to help the issue alongside long term sustainable alternatives

- Consider the importance of education in context of the issue
