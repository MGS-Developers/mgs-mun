This year at MGSMUN our Special Committee is on Technology. Technology is becoming a more significant part of our everyday lives - we feel that this committee is extremely relevant in our increasingly internet-centric and globally connected world.

The two issues that we will be debating are very different in nature, but I believe that they are both equally important to discuss. The issue of Closing the Technology Gap asks the crucial questions of how we can make sure less developed countries get access to the technology needed to be able to improve their healthcare, education, and economic development. It also goes beyond this by asking how we can empower these countries and the people within them to create technology for themselves. We hope to debate technologies that significantly benefit each member state individually, as well as those that have a global impact.

Our second Issue on Cryptocurrencies asks the challenging questions that need to be answered over such new and decentralised currencies. From their lack of stability and security to their environmental impact and lack of regulation, it is time for the UN to take some action – this starts with your resolutions!

I encourage you to research the issues and your country’s position (or lack thereof) on these matters. Submitting a resolution is a great way to demonstrate your knowledge and creativity when addressing these challenging issues. Whether you are an experienced delegate or a ‘first-timer’, I hope that you will enjoy our conference, and I look forward to welcoming you on December 11th.
