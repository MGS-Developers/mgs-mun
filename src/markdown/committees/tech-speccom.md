This year at MGSMUN we have decided to do our special committee on Technology. Technology is increasingly becoming part of our everyday lives and hence we feel that this committee is extremely relevant.

The two issues that we will be debating are very different in nature, but I believe that they are both equally relevant. The issue of Closing the Technology Gap asks the crucial questions of how we can make sure less developed countries get access to the technology needed to be able to improve their health care, education, and economic development. It also goes beyond this asking, how we can empower these countries and people to create technology for themselves which could not only massively impact them but also other countries worldwide.

The second Issue on Cryptocurrencies ask the challenging questions that need to be answered over these relatively new currencies. From their lack of stability and security to their environmental impact and lack of regulation, it is time for the UN to take some action and that starts with your resolutions.

I strongly encourage you to do some basic research on the issues and your countries view on that matter. Submitting a resolution is a great way to demonstrate your knowledge and creativity when addressing these challenging issues. Even if your resolution is not chosen, we will have reviewed and consider it for when we decide who will receive the awards for the conference. Whether you are experienced or a newer delegate, I hope that you will enjoy our conference, and I look forward to welcoming you all on the 11th of December.
