This year at MGSMUN we are pleased to hold a Political Committee. We will be discussing two major issues: the South China Sea and foreign interference in elections.

The South China Sea is a mesh of numerous overlapping territorial claims. None of the nations involved want to relinquish their claims, and this brings us to the crucial question of what makes one claim legitimate and another not. How can – if at all – the UN fairly divide the sea, and what can it do to prevent more powerful nations strongarming weaker nations out of their positions. Any attempt at solving this problem could have huge impacts on the economy and security of the countries involved, and as such it needs to be approached carefully.

Foreign interference in elections is something that is not too uncommon to hear about. In many nations, from the largest to the smallest, there will be people who claim that foreign parties changed the outcome of their elections – one need only look at Trump in response to the latest presidential election. What action can the UN take to prevent this, and, when both sides claim that the other is helped by foreign parties, who can the UN trust?

We strongly encourage you to research your nation’s views on the issues. A great way to showcase your knowledge and creativity would be to submit a resolution, and even if it doesn't get picked, it will be considered when deciding which delegates will win awards. No matter how much experience you have, we hope you enjoy our conference, and look forward to seeing you there on December 11th.

> All resolutions must be emailed to hill-aspinallp-y16@mgs.org before 23:59 on Friday 10th December. Please put your country and issue within the subject line.
