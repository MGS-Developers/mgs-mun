# The Issue of Ocean Pollution
The degradation of the oceans is an issue which has plagued the world for a long time, but its worst effects may yet bear their heads.

The oceans are being polluted by our waste and rubbish, particularly plastic. We empty 300 million tonnes of waste into the ocean every year, a number than is on the rise. The vast majority of the waste in the ocean is generated on land (around 80%) and plastic (nearly 70%.) The remaining 20% is made up of things like buoys and marine transportation pollution. Any solution to the degeneration of the ocean will necessarily include the consumption and disposal of resources taking place on land.

While plastic and other materials make up the bulk of ocean pollution, toxic chemicals finding their ways into the sea has also caused all manner of problems. Industrial disasters on land, such as the Fukushima nuclear plant breach, can end up having even more effects on the marine life. While the days of pacific islands as nuclear test sites are over, delegates should still consider regulations surrounding the disposal of chemicals.

On a broader note, the oceans face nuanced impacts of human exploitation of resources and waste. Noise pollution has become increasingly prevalent as it disrupts the activities of essential marine species with its vibrations. It has also been known to confuse animals who use a form of sonar to see under the water. Ocean degradation has occurred in the form of acidification, as the water takes in more carbon released by the burning of fossil fuels. This also has detrimental effects on the wildlife, as species evolved to live in more chemically neutral waters.

Ignoring this problem is only going to get harder: by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. Unlike carbon emissions, the waste added to the ocean every year is projected to grow and there is no global strategy or media attention for this issue. Solutions to this problem need to not only fix current effects in the ocean but do their best to reduce the output of waste into the ocean. It is a complex and difficult issue with interlocking economic and environmental concerns, but one we must tackle.

If I had one piece of advice it would be that there are lots of problems here; you may not be able to solve every single one. Don’t worry! Try your best to focus on the issues you think are most important and find a workable solution by working with others, which is what MUN is really all about. This is quite a technical issue, so I’d advise doing some wider reading to broaden your understanding.  

## Points to Consider
- Should we focus on dealing with the problems we have currently, or on preventing them worsening due to future pollution?

- How can we reduce waste output into the ocean?

- How can we get it out of the ocean?

- Do we need more regulations and/or punishments for the deposition of toxic chemicals in the sea?

- How do we deal with the deaths of specific species that could occur from this, and the impacts that has on biodiversity?

- What steps should we take given that microplastics have entered the food chain, and we ingest them every day?
