# The Issue of Ocean Pollution
The degradation of the oceans is an issue which has plagued the world for decades, but its worst effects may not yet have been felt.

The oceans are being polluted by our waste and rubbish, most particularly plastics. We empty 300 million tonnes of waste into the ocean every year - a number than is on the rise. The vast majority of the waste in the ocean is generated on land (around 80%) and from plastics (nearly 70%.) The remaining 20% is made up of things like oceanic buoys and pollution from marine transportation. Any solution to the degeneration of the ocean will necessarily include tackling the consumption and disposal of resources taking place on land.

While plastic and other materials make up the bulk of ocean pollution, toxic chemicals entering the sea has also caused all manner of problems. Industrial disasters on land, such as the Fukushima nuclear plant breach, can end up having considerably greater effects on marine life. While the days of pacific islands as nuclear test sites are over, delegates should still consider regulations surrounding the disposal of chemicals, to reduce widespread toxic ocean pollution in the coming decades.

On a broader note, the oceans face more nuanced impacts resulting from human exploitation of resources and waste. Noise pollution has become increasingly prevalent as it disrupts the activities of essential marine species through its vibrations, as well as having been known to confuse animals who use a form of sonar to see under the water. Ocean degradation has occurred in the form of acidification, as the oceans themselves absorb more carbon emitted by the burning of fossil fuels. This also has detrimental effects on marine wildlife, as most species evolved to live in more chemically neutral waters.

Ignoring this problem is only going to get more difficult, and the consequences more problematic: by 2050 there is projected to be more plastic than fish in the ocean. Unlike carbon emissions, the waste added to the ocean every year is projected to grow continuously, yet there being no global strategy and little media attention paid to this issue. Solutions to this issue need to not only fix current effects plaguing our oceans but do their best to reduce the output of waste into the ocean. It is a complex and difficult debate with interlocking economic and environmental concerns, but one we certainly must tackle, given humanity's intrinsic dependence on a healthy ocean.

If we had one piece of advice it would be that there are lots of problems to deal with here; you may not be able to solve every single one. Donâ€™t worry! Try your best to focus on the issues you think are most important and find a pragmatic solution by working with others, which is what MUN is really all about. This is quite a technical issue, so we'd advise doing some wider reading to broaden your understanding (see the links below for ideas).

## Points to Consider
- Should our focus be on dealing with the problems we have currently, or on preventing them worsening due to future pollution?

- How can we reduce our waste output into the ocean?

- How can we get waste out of the ocean/begin to "clean it up"?

- Do we need more regulations and/or penalties dealing with the deposition of toxic chemicals in the sea, and can these be mandated on an international level?

- How do we deal with the deaths of specific, most-affected species that could occur from this pollution, and the impacts that such consequences would have on biodiversity?

- What steps should we take given that microplastics have entered the food chain and we ingest them every day, including through our consumption of fish?
