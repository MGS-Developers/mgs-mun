Welcome TO MGSMUN 2021 DISEC. With ever increasingly powerful weapons being invented and a variety of different diplomatically difficult situations emerging, it is the responsibility of DISEC to regulate and manage the use and creation of these weapons and to help maintain international security through debate and co-operation. The two issues that DISEC will be debating pertain to the sky and to the sea.

First is the issue of nuclear-powered submarines, which has been made a contentious issue through the signing of the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine deal that was announced on the 15th September 2021, countering Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region. This leads to the questions of the regulation of the construction and use of nuclear submarines, whether they should be permitted in contented areas such as the South China Sea, and the effects nuclear-powered submarine technology may have on world peace as a whole.

The second issue is the use of drones in Afghan airspace and further aerial operations from the USA or an allied country in the area. Since the US withdrew from Afghanistan on August 30th 2021, there has been the contentious issue of foreign aircraft in and around Afghanistan airspace, with the USA recently signing a deal with Pakistan to use Pakistani airspace to conduct surveillance operations in Afghanistan, in addition to US drones being used to assassinate . This leads to issues of whether the US should be permitted to use drones in Afghanistan to target anti-US terrorists, Afghan sovereignty, and wider treaties in relation to the use of autonomous drones and airspace agreements.

Please take time in researching your issues thoroughly, focus on your countries positions and involvement in these issues, and it is recommended you produce a resolution on one of these issues. Regardless of your prior experience in Model united nations, we look forward to seeing you at the conference in December.
