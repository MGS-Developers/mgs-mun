# The Issue of Inaccessibility to Medicines
A lack of access to medicines causes a cascade of misery and suffering: from the lack of relief for the excruciating pain of a childâ€™s earache, to women who bleed to death during childbirth, to deaths from diseases that are prevented or cured relatively easily and cheaply. The issue of a lack of access to medicines is a key tenet of inequality that can be measured by a starkly visible yardstick: numbers of preventable deaths.

Efforts to improve access to medicines are driven by a compelling ethical imperative - indeed, this is also a Human Rights issue. Citizens should not be denied access to life-saving or health-promoting interventions on the premise of unfairness, most notably due to economic and social reasons such as poverty and isolation. Millions of yearly childhood deaths from diseases that could have been prevented or cured by existing medical products should be unthinkable in a fair and just world. An estimated two billion people have no access to essential medicines, effectively shutting them off from the benefits of our advances in modern science and medicine.

The inaccessibility of medicine is perpetuated by the lack of availability and affordability of medication, supply chain regulations, and national drug policies. Poor procurement practices, entailing inefficient production and purchasing of medicine, among the governments of member states catalyse frequent stock-outs in local and rural pharmacies. Furthermore, a lack of local manufacturers and an overwhelming majority of medicine being imported, leads to excessively high costs and poor exchange rates, engendering medicine that is neither affordable to the average civilian nor suited to the needs of impoverished regions and nations. Consequently, hospital staff in nations across the globe are left with no alternative but to prescribe painkillers as universal medication; such painkillers are ineffective in the combating of specific illnesses, such as rashes and the common cold. Additionally, the inaccessibility of medicine further stimulates the creation of counterfeit drugs that hold no probative medical value and may contain dangerous toxins.

Many civilians around the globe are thus left with two choices: leaving an illness or infection untreated or paying a hefty price for treatment. By choosing to treat themselves, families, especially in developing nations, are required to sell a family asset - such as cattle or a home - perpetuating an intergenerational poverty cycle. Those who are wholly unable to afford treatment are left in pain and misery. Given this is a Health and Human Rights concern, member states of the United Nations should attempt to agree a framework to make medication more accessible to all, regardless of wealth.

## Case study: Syria

In no member state is the issue of the lack of access to medications more pronounced than in Syria.

Prior to the Syrian Civil War, over 90 percent of medicines in Syria were produced locally. Given that much of the nation has been a war zone since March 2011, Syria has faced countless infrastructural and economic barriers to producing medicine, resulting in a 90 percent drop in the availability of general medicines throughout the nation. Today, Syria lacks the personnel, infrastructure, and facilities to distribute medicine, including in circumstances where the consequences will be fatal. One-quarter of a million civilians, including 948 healthcare workers, have died during the military conflict within the past nine years. Furthermore, 566 attacks have been documented on 348 healthcare facilities. Only five years into the conflict did the Syrian government approve a medicine shipment to a hospital in Aleppo, leaving civilians who are injured as collateral damage in the war effort, or sick, as largely unable to access necessary medication. The lack of facilities poses various difficulties in the administration of medicines to citizens. Although initiatives have been launched by NGOs in Syria, including the humanitarian efforts of MSF to establish medicine distribution and healthcare camps, several non-government organizations have been forced to exit the region due to safety precautions and the ongoing conflict.

## Points to Consider

- How can medicine be made accessible in regions experiencing military conflict or warfare, such as Syria?

- What actions must member states take in terms of procuring medicine to ensure that medicine is secure?

- How do national and international drug laws and policies impact medicine accessibility?

- How can access to medicine be strengthened in the short-term and the long-term?

- Can the economics of medicine be tailored to fit regional needs and price requirements? How can this be implemented?

- What barriers must be overcome to ensure that civilians in your country are able to access medicine? What solutions can you implement to achieve this?
