This year at the MGSMUN Health & Social Committee, we will be debating two relevant issues of utmost concern which has been at the centre of our lives and needs to be addressed by the committee.

The inaccessibility of medicines has been a worrying issue for many years as many developing nations lack access to basic medicines, the most current being COVID-19 vaccines. The focus on this debate should be on how we can equally distribute these medicines whilst overcoming barriers such as counterfeit drugs, especially in regions experiencing conflict.

The second issue we will be debating focuses on better preparation for future pandemics and how we can prevent the drastic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which are still prevalent. In January 2021, an independent panel stated that the WHO’s existing pandemic alert system “is not fit for purpose” and that “a new global framework is needed to support prevention of and protection from pandemics, and I hope that we can aim to rectify this with your resolutions.

Though challenging and multifaceted, I have no doubt that the deliberations of these topics will be thorough and will breed comprehensive resolutions. I invite you all, whether you are a beginner or an experienced delegate, to exit your comfort zone and partake in discussing these pressing issues. I look forward to greeting you all at MGSMUN on the 11th of December!
