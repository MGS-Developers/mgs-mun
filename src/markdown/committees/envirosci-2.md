# The Issue of Sustainable Transport
Transport as a sector is constantly evolving to incorporate modern technologies and facing new challenges, including becoming ever-more important in the digital age.

Sustainability is a huge challenge that transport must evolve and adapt to overcome. Transport, as the third most emissions-heavy sector, makes up over 16% of the world’s carbon emissions. Any net-zero future is going to require a strategy of decarbonisation and energy efficiency in transit. Sustainable power sources such as electric batteries and hydrogen will need to be considered, but even embracing these new technologies may not be enough to make air travel, for example, sustainable. Ultimately, the question of achieving the sustainability of transportation will play a crucial role both in how many people live their lives, and in the UN’s fight against climate change.

Automation is also worth considering when it comes to the future of transportation. Member states such as the UK have laws preventing full automation of transport, so delegates will have to consider the costs and benefits of embracing such a technology.

A huge question which member states must answer is whether to invest in public (buses, trains, planes etc.) or private (cars, bicycles, motorcycles) forms of transport. Several private companies have now launched commercial space flights, and as that market grows, questions must again be asked about resource allocation. Furthermore, self-driving cars are becoming more and more commonplace with the rapid development of Tesla cars, for example, with varied results.

Several technologies touted as successors to trains and cars in the 20th century are being given a second look. Maglev trains which work by using large magnets below the tracks, and have greater speed and efficiency than conventional rail, have seen renewed investment. Monorails once dismissed as a gimmick have seen limited application. Even things we are more familiar with, such as buses, trams and trolleybuses are being looked over and improved. It's possible we already have the transportation of the future, and that we just need to invest further in developing it.

Looking to the future, another mode of transport being developed is the hyperloop – ventures by SpaceX and Richard Branson’s Virgin are already being tested. Some consider hyperloops the future of passenger and freight transportation; others believe they have fatal flaws and are over-hyped in this capacity.

For this issue, it can be easy to get bogged down in specific technological details. The hyperloop for example has been touted as the future of transportation, but critics label it as expensive, inefficient and gimmicky. We urge all delegates to try and come up with answers to the questions posed and work backwards to decide on specific technologies or approaches. Be prepared to change your own position as you read!

Regardless, each country will most definitely have its own opinion & policies on transportation – so make sure you research this! What may help you out is that the majority of governments are quite flexible: there is a general feeling that emissions should be curbed, a common aspiration of embracing new technologies and of course, hopes for a cheap and easy solution to every problem. You are, of course, welcome to submit resolutions on any topic related to the future of transport – feel free to use this briefing paper as a guide.

## Points to Consider

- How will automation technologies affect transport and how should we accommodate for them?

- Should we focus on public or individual forms of transit?

- Is it more important to make better use of current technology or invest in new transportation methods?

- How can modern transportation make cities safer for everyone?

- How can transport evolve to be more sustainable and meet climate targets?
