# The Issue of Creating an International Pandemic Treaty
The COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge. No single government or institution can address the threat of future pandemics alone. And hence the main goal of a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response would be to foster a comprehensive, multi-sectoral approach to strengthen national, regional and global capacities to deal with, and resilience to, future pandemics. This is an opportunity for the world to come together as a global community for peaceful cooperation that extends beyond this crisis, and send a signal of nations beginning to work together to ensure the disunity and haphazardness of the COVID-19 response is not repeated.

The proposal for a treaty is guided by a spirit of collective solidarity, anchored in the principles of fairness, inclusiveness and transparency. Neither individual governments nor the global community can entirely prevent pandemics. But the international community certainly needs to be much better prepared and better aligned in responding to possible future pandemics across the entire cycle of detection, alarm and response, and this can be led by the work of the United Nations and its World Health Organisation. The treaty should set out the objectives and fundamental principles structuring the necessary collective action to fight pandemics.

An international treaty on pandemics would support and focus on:

- Early detection and prevention of pandemics

- Resilience to future pandemics

- The Response to any future pandemics, in particular by ensuring universal and equitable access to medical solutions, such as vaccines, medicines and diagnostics

- A stronger international health framework within the premise of the WHO as the coordinating authority on global health matters

- The "One Health" approach, connecting the health of humans, animals and our planet

More specifically, such a treaty can enhance international cooperation in a number of priority areas, such as surveillance, alerts and response, but also, more generally, build trust in the international health system.

## Points to Consider

- What measures can we take to ensure a faster response time to future pandemics?

- How can we promote co-ordination between member states to fight pandemics?

- How can we adopt the “One Health” approach into the prevention of future pandemics?

- How can we ensure that the effects that pandemics have on LEDCs are less severe, for example lack of access to vaccines and limited health services?

- Would your country be open to signing up to an international treaty dealing with these key issues, as a means of reducing the likelihood of future pandemics?
