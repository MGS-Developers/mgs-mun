# The Issue of Unaccompanied Migrant Children and Adolescents
It is clear that there is a pressing issue around unaccompanied migrant children and adolescents, which are categorised in several ways, as a UN report on the issue made clear:

There are three main categories of unaccompanied and separated children, each of which requires a unique response from member states:

1. Children separated from their family or caregivers during the move.

2. Children who started their journey as unaccompanied or separated children and are currently travelling with groups of people. Most are males aged 14-17 years who avoid being registered or pretend to be young adults;
 
3. Children who have interrupted their migration owing to a lack of resources. In the context of the European migrant crisis, children in this category are often found in urban areas in Greece and Italy and are particularly vulnerable to all types of abuse, exploitation, trafficking, enrolment by criminal groups and violence.

According to UNICEF, in 2020 nearly 34 million refuges and asylum seekers were forcibly displaced from their own countries, and half of them were children. The issue remains prevalent because unaccompanied minors without definitive legal status are often subject to exploitation and abuse in the countries they arrive in. This is particularly significant when most of these children migrate in order to flee persecution or violence.

The issue of smuggling is also of pressing concern. For example, as of 2014 an estimated 75-80% of unaccompanied children arriving at the US-Mexico border had travelled with smugglers. Some of these smugglers are known to exploit unaccompanied children, selling them to human traffickers or forcing them into situations of forced labour and prostitution. Often children are left with smugglers by their parents under the impression that they’ll have a better chance of “making it” by themselves. Deporting children upon arrival in another country can perpetuate the issue of exploitation.

## Some stats to consider:

- At least 200,000 unaccompanied and separated children were registered in about 80 countries in 2015 and 2016 (United Nations Children’s Fund UNICEF, 2017).

- There are 170,000 unaccompanied children who have sought asylum in Europe in those years (United Nations Children’s Fund UNICEF, 2017).

- 100,000 unaccompanied children were arrested at the Mexican-US border, and 19,000 sought asylum in other countries (United Nations Children’s Fund UNICEF, 2017).

## Points to Consider:

- What should we do with unaccompanied migrant children arriving at our borders

- How can we stop unaccompanied migrant children getting separated from their parents or carers

- How can we stop children from being exploited by smugglers, or in their countries of arrival

- Should unaccompanied migrant children be granted asylum in their countries of arrival?

- How can we support unaccompanied migrant children on arrival (alleviating trauma, finding shelter etc.)
