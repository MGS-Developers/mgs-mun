# The Issue of Election Security
Free and fair elections are a crucial part of a stable, democratic society. Given the competitive nature of many of these elections in member states around the world, it is not uncommon for politicians running for office to claim that they were cheated out of a win by either those in power in their nation or those in foreign nations. But these claims of election tampering are only dealt with by the judicial system of that nation, and if the election has been tampered with, then it could conceivably be possible that the investigation could be tampered with too. One example of this is the response to the 2009 Iranian election. Given a key UN aim is to preserve and promote democracy in member states, could we act to ensure the continuation of free and fair elections around the globe whilst avoiding the inevitable backlash that "interfering" would pertain?

External influence is a common topic in claims of election tampering, as it was in complaints about the conduction of the 2016 US presidential election, resulting in the Muller investigation into claims of election fraud. Both personal information about candidates and online vote counting is hugely vulnerable to cyberattacks, such as those from pro-Russian hackers who attempted to disrupt and alter the outcome of the 2014 Ukrainian election. The UK continues to have ongoing investigations into foreign interference in the Brexit referendum. It is possible that UN involvement in elections could improve their security, as it has done in many fledgling democracies holding their first sets of elections in the past, but questions may also be asked about how secure online election systems can be. Whilst they increase the ease of managing voting, they open up vote counting to a key vector of attack.

Many of the individuals, groups and nations that have influenced the outcomes of elections have walked away with no punishment. But should it be up to the UN to deliver punishments here, instead of the nations involved? It is clear that people who alter vote tallies have interfered with the election, but it is less clear whether foreign political leaders expressing their opinions should also be counted as interference, and to what extent such an influence would be. Indeed, the issue of national election integrity is such a sensitive one to member states across the world, that any good UN intentions could be mischaracterised in a negative light. It is therefore extremely important to not only have robust systems protecting election integrity, but also checks and balances on that system in itself, and a culture of transparency and openness. 

## Points to Consider
- Should we establish a new UN body to investigate claims of election misconduct?
- What protections can be put in place — on an international level — to protect elections from outside influence?
- Should member states use online methods for voting and vote-counting, considering the cybersecurity risk?
- What response should the UN have to individuals, groups or member states that attempt to change the outcome of elections?
