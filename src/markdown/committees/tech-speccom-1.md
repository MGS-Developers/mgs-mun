# The Issue of Closing the Technology Gap
Definitions: technology - products and services involving a connection to the internet or fostering online communication (e.g. laptops, mobile phones and tablets).

As the world keeps moving forward with developing new technologies, many Low Income Countries (LICs) have been left behind with massively outdated technology, or no technology at all. These countries have struggled to draw in the investment from other countries and Trans-National Corporations (TNCs) which likely means that without UN action these countries won't be able to catch up with the rest of the world. One of the main problems is structural limitations within LICs which can limit the countries' progress in areas like science, technology and innovation (STI).

A major hurdle to overcome in order to help close the technology gap lies within education. In 2015, almost 40% of children and adolescents not in education were from LICs. This problem is more apparent with tertiary education where the enrolment ratio in 2013 was less than 9% in LICs compared to 33% worldwide. Addressing this education divide will help to provide a long term solution to closing the technology gap, by ensuring more countries have access to experts in STI.

The lack of developed high-speed connectivity and broadband in LICs, where it is inaccessible and unaffordable, also hinders technology advancements. Improved broadband would bring massive educational, health and financial benefits to LICs and thus is critical to closing the technology gap. It is essential that we empower and equip governments and the private sector to provide this crucial infrastructure to LICs.

Having affordable access to technology - once infrastructure problems are addressed - is another major issue. With the costs of building infrastructure to support the development of technology falling on the consumer, this has made it a burden on those living in LICs, limiting the scope and potential of technological development. We must also consider that we should attempt to do this in the most environmentally friendly way possible to avoid worsening climate change.

This issue remains incredibly challenging to address and thus there has been limited UN action towards achieving it. There are many complexities to take into account, especially given the fragile economies in many LICs, which have been massively impacted by the pandemic. Below are some points to consider but feel free to expand on these points and address other related issues but remember to stay focused on closing the technology gap. Hopefully together we can find a solution to this significant challenge.

## Points to Consider

- What can be done in the short term to address the growing technology gap between LDC's and more developed countries?

- What can the UN do to help to address the lack of infrastructure to support the use of technology within LDC'S especially for STI?

- How can we help empower people within LDC's to help develop there own new technologies?

- How can the UN work with private companies and charities to introduce technology into new areas at a cheaper rate to ensure affordability?

- Should this be seen as a pressing issue for LDC's or are other issues more important?

- What do we do to ensure that technology introduced doesn't have a massive enviromental impact?
