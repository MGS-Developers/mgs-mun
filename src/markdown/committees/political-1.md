# The Issue of Territorial Claims in the South China Sea
In the South China sea, territorial claims from Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and China all overlap. One of the main reasons that these claims conflict with each other is due to all five nations claiming different islands in the mostly-uninhabited Spratly Island archipelago. In and around this archipelago, China has been building islands, such as Mischief Reef, and using them to bolster its territorial claims. The area that China claims, known as the nine-dashed line, pre-dates the UN and any of the rules subsequently created regarding territorial claims in the sea.

As this is an issue that only pertains to a few nations in a specific region of the world, it may be unclear whether the UN should weigh in on the claims and mediate any discussions/decisions taken regarding them. Although outside interference may be seen as powerful nations supporting their allies by lobbying for them to have a greater claim to the area, but without any influence from the UN it could be possible for a larger nation to strong-arm a smaller nation out of its claim. Chinaâ€™s construction of gun turrets and airstrips in the Spratly Island archipelago are seen by many as strong-arming.

Whilst some of the claims may appear unrealistically extensive, nations like China see them as absolutely necessary for national security. In the event of a future war, China, a superpower with only a single coastline onto an ocean bordered by South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, the Indochinese peninsula and Borneo, could be realistically blockaded by a naval coalition, which would have a dramatic impact on its largely export-based economy. Existing UN agreements on the extent of territorial claims offshore (Article 3, UN Convention on the Law of the Sea) means that all member states can establish claims up to twelve nautical miles offshore from their land territories, but it may be necessary for the UN revise these guidelines given the significant impact of global trade on the economies of member states, and national security concerns.

## Points to Consider

- How should the UN deal with member states claiming artificial islands as their territory?

- Should the UN consider claims to territory based on historical events (e.g. Should Taiwan (by some accounts the legitimate Chinese government) be entitled to the same claim as the People's Republic of China)?

- Should the UN attempt to mediate solutions to overlapping territorial claims, or should such issues be left to the member states making the claims?

- Should the UN change the distance offshore up to which nations can make territorial claims?
