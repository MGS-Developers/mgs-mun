# The Issue of Anti-Discrimination Education
Before you consider the issue of racism and discrimination, take a quick guess at how many hate crimes are reported, on average, every day in England and Wales alone. If you said over 330, you’d be right. In 2020/21, over 124,000 hate crimes were _reported_ __in England and Wales alone__.[^1] Why has this figure increased almost three-fold since 2012/13? Why is this figure still growing? Why is this not made more apparent to us? Many critics, such as those who work at The Black Curriculum, believe that anti-racism discrimination is key to tackling this issue.[^2]

Yet changing the curriculum is not as easy as many might think. A lengthy process including convincing the bosses of the member state's Education Ministry (or equivalent), as well as aligning the goals with those of teachers’ unions, campaigning groups, and pupils, can not only stop it from being actualised, but also – even if the changes are actualised – they may be nowhere near as effective and meaningful as they should be. It should also be noted that there may be a lack of representation in member states’ Education Ministries (or equivalent), making this issue perhaps also one of systemic inequality.

There is also an argument that Anti-Discrimination Education can come from the ground up, through pupils in schools, thus side-stepping the issue of needing a large-scale reform of the curriculum. Clubs, societies, and talks within school give young people an opportunity to voice their opinions. Yet how effective are these in actually educating everyone within school? Perhaps it is the teachers too that need to be taught – every year we hear horrifying stories of teachers racially abusing students.

Ultimately, we need to think about the best, most effective way of exposing young people to the realities and destructive nature of learnt or acquired discriminatory behaviour. Research your member state's positions on the matter and be prepared to debate on the efficacy of changes actualised (if any), your Education Ministry's (or equivalent) nature and prior approach to the issue, and the interpretation of human rights in regard to educational settings.

## Points to Consider:

- What is the education system like in your member state right now?

- Can we implement a ‘Global Curriculum’ or expand ‘Human Rights Friendly Schools’?

- To what extent is this a Human Rights concern?

- To what extent should parents have agency over what their child is taught in school?

  N.B. This is a huge issue in US politics at the moment - Glenn Youngkin captured the Virginia Governorship largely on the misconception of 'Critical Race Theory' being taught in schools without parents' consent.

- What specific changes would you make to the education system(s)?

- What can the UN do to help/support member states?

- What additional issues might LICs face?
