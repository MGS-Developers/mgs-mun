EnviroSci, more than anything, is a committee about the kind of future we want to live in. The two issues we have chosen this year are both things which will have great consequences on the future, but may have been swept under the rug by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ocean pollution is going to have huge impact on us in the coming years. Water is possibly the most precious resource to life, but our seas are quickly being contaminated by chemicals and waste created by humans. Rising carbon emissions have caused an acidification of the oceans. Waste being dumped in the sea has created huge features like the great pacific garbage patch. However, countries may rely on the consumerism and industry that fuels this pollution. A question must be asked about how to go about reducing ocean pollution.

Transport is also a critical issue, but no one has been travelling! As the world opens back up and starts a million car, train, and plane engines, we are going to have to face the challenges of the future. How can transport adapt to the net-zero carbon emissions many countries have promised by 2050? How will newer automation technologies affect transportation? How will global supply chains recover and rebuild after COVID-19? Technological advancement isn’t necessarily going to mean advancement for transport. We hope you’ll be ready with some ideas at MGSMUN.

When preparing for this committee, I would encourage you to not only read the briefing paper, but also read around the issues. There are so many different directions you can approach these issues from. EnviroSci is the committee of new ideas. Writing a resolution is a fantastic way to broaden your understanding of the issues, and I would recommend everyone to come prepared with at least one idea of an amendment to one of the issues. We are going to have a higher-than-average number of new delegates in our committee this year, so I hope that these issues are interesting enough to excite you about MUN. To any more experienced delegates, I hope you also find the issues interesting and come prepared with solutions for ocean pollution and the development of transport.
