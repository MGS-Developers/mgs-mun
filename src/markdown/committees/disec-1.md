# The Issue of Nuclear Submarine Treaties
Nuclear-powered submarines are submarines that operate using nuclear energy (Note; they do not necessarily, and often don’t, carry nuclear weapons). Many member states have such nuclear-powered submarines in their navies, including the US, China, Russia, India, France and the UK (including Vanguard class submarines responsible for the delivery of the Trident missile system). Nations including Brazil, Argentina and Australia also have this technology under some form of development. Contrarily, other nations, such as New Zealand, are extremely resistant to this technology due of their effectiveness, safety and the fact that they are operated only by the aforementioned six countries. Indeed, New Zealand has taken the step of prohibiting all nuclear-powered craft from its territorial waters, even if these are operated by close allies. Yet Nuclear-powered submarines can operate for months continuously without detection underwater, have a range limited only by supplies and technical faults, and are extremely effective. They are often employed by member states in areas under contention to assert sovereignty and rights over certain bodies of water.

Since the foundation of the United Nations, there have been several treaties attempting to govern their use, for example the AUKUS deal (see below). Other major deals include the 1958 US-UK procurement deal. The only stance taken by the UN itself is the exception given to their use in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968).

The AUKUS deal, between Australia, the United Kingdom and the US, is a pact of cooperation between the three nations on the issues of cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and quantum technologies, but mainly in order to aid the Australian navy with the acquisition of nuclear powered submarines for deployment in the Indo-Pacific Region (with particular attention given to China, although the UK denies this).

This is an extremely controversial development for two main reasons:

Firstly, this is seen as an adversarial move against China. For decades, China has claimed a large portion of the South China Sea - although this has received little international recognition - and powers such as the US and the UK regularly sail ships through the region to assert their position that the area of the "nine-dash line" is not under Chinese sovereignty. In response to this, China has been building islands in the region equipped with airfields, deep-water ports and other military facilities in an attempt to solidify their claim. The AUKUS deal will equip the Australian navy with the means to patrol these waters, alongside close allies the US and UK, and reinforce robust opposition to China’s claim. This has caused concern amongst many nations to the tune that increasing tensions and militarisation in the region may lead to escalation and conflict – or at least that the deal will greatly sour relations between China and the US, which is a crucial one to global security.

Secondly, there is the issue of a pre-existing deal between France and Australia for the French to supply the Australians with conventional, diesel-powered submarines. The negotiation of the AUKUS deal necessitated that the Australians pull out of the deal with France, which has left the French government furious. Indeed, the French government withdrew its ambassadors to Australia and the US and has threatened a full diplomatic blow-up.

## Points to Consider

- Should nations be permitted to acquire/develop Nuclear-powered submarines?

- Should there be more detailed UN legislation governing their use?

- Should places of contention such as the South China Sea become more or less militarised (especially by means of Nuclear-powered submarines)?

- Is the AUKUS deal positive for:

  - Your country?

  - Anti-Chinese unity?

  - World peace?

- Was it right/acceptable for Australia to pull out of their pre-existing procurement deal with France?
