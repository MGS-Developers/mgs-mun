# The Issue of Nuclear Submarine Treaties
Nuclear submarines are submarines that run off of nuclear energy (note, they do not necessarily, and often don’t, carry nuclear weapons). Many nations’ navies have such nuclear-powered submarines, including France, the UK (and its Trident program), the USA, China, Russia and India, while other countries, such as New Zealand, are extremely wary of such for the reasons of their effectiveness and the fact that they are only owned by the aforementioned six countries. These submarines can go for weeks on end without detection under the water, and are extremely effective. They are often employed by nations in contentious areas to assert positions regarding rights to certain waters.

In the time of the UN, there have been many treaties attempting to govern their use, for example the AUKUS deal which is explained below. Other major deals include the 1958 US-UK deal. The only stance taken by the UN is an exception given to them in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1968.

The AUKUS deal, between Australia, the United Kingdom and the USA is a deal to cooperate between the three countries on the issues of cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and quantum technologies, but mainly to aid the Australian navy with the acquisition of nuclear powered submarines for deployment in the Indo-Pacific Region (with particular attention given to China, although the UK denies this).

This is extremely controversial for two main reasons.

Firstly, this is seen as an adversarial move against China. For decades, China has claimed a large portion of the South China Sea, although this receives little international recognition, and powers such as the USA and the UK regularly sail ships through the region to assert their position that the waters are not Chinese. In response to this, China has been building islands in the region equipped with military bases in an attempt to solidify their claim. The AUKUS deal will equip the Australian navy with the means to sail these waters alongside the USA and UK and create a stronger opposition to China’s claim. This has caused concern amongst many nations that increasing tensions and militarisation in the region may lead to escalation and conflict – or at least that the deal will greatly sour relations between China and the USA.

Secondly, there is the issue of a pre-existing deal between France and Australia for the French to supply the Australians with nuclear-powered submarines. The reaching of the AUKUS deal necessitated that the Australians pull out of the deal with France, which has left the French government furious.

## Points to Consider

- Should nations be encouraged to acquire nuclear submarines?

- Should there be UN legislation governing their use?

- Should places of contention such as the South China Sea become more or less militarised (especially by nuclear submarines)?

- Is the AUKUS deal a good idea for:

    - Your country?

    - Anti-Chinese unity?

    - World peace?

- Was it right for Australia to pull out of the deal with France?
