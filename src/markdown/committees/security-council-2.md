# The Issue of Afghanistan

For decades, Afghanistan has been a pressing regional stability concern, and international security threat. A former victim of colonisation, the country was taken over by the communist People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) in a bloody coup in 1978. After 18 months of horrific collapse in government, the Soviet Union invaded the country in 1979, sparking the beginning of the Soviet-Afghan war that plagued the country for a decade, with the resistance Mujahideen fighters - supported by the United States and others - opposing the power grab. After the Soviets withdrew in 1988-89, an unstable coalition of various opposition forces took power and the country descended into further anarchy. Emerging in 1994 from neighbouring Pakistan, the clerical and hardline Islamist Taliban militant group began to take over provinces, eventually expelling the weak government from Kabul in 1996 and establishing their first Islamic emirate, which received little international recognition and was widely condemned for deeply-conservative policies and regular human rights abuses. Massacres against Afghan citizens, denying UN aid and conducting a ‘scorched earth’ policy of agricultural destruction, which caused widespread famine. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, the US and coalition forces invaded Afghanistan in order to protect international security, given the nation had been harbouring the Al-Qaeda terrorist group and its leader Osama bin-Laden, who were responsible for conducting the attacks - the Taliban government refused to hand him over for international detention. Thus followed 17 years of rule by the US-backed Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which was underpinned by a continuous coalition garrison to keep the Taliban, which were far from completely destroyed, from retaking control of major cities. However, after President Trump agreed a deal with the Taliban to withdraw by May 2021, the nation began to withdraw its military forces - a policy continued by President Biden through 2021. This led to more-rapid-than-expected Taliban gains, and them securing control of the nation again in September 2021, 20 years after the US and allies removed them from power.

The new Taliban government, surprised at the extent of its reconquest of the nation as the Afghan defence forces crumbled, formed a government with reconciliatory rhetoric. Although pledging to govern within the framework of Islam and so-called Shari’ah Law, the Taliban promised to be more moderate on issues like women’s employment and education, and to work to secure the nation and prevent the formation of terrorist groups. However, much of this is thought to have been mere rhetoric, as a crackdown on the opposition has been accelerating, and gender and religious equality is once again coming under threat. The international community has hence refused to work with the Taliban Administration, with vital UN funds being withheld and virtually no international recognition forthcoming. We have since seen a dramatic collapse of the fragile humanitarian situation in the nation, which is on the verge of becoming a major famine.

Following the fall of Kabul, said humanitarian situation has become dire for those living in Afghanistan: 23 million of 40 have no certain food supply; the infant mortality rate has soared to become the highest in the world; the initiative to create a banking system has been left in ruins with the freezing of all assets; women are being barred from education; religious sects, those in a minority regarding sexual orientation, former government officials, protestors, and anyone seen not to be conforming to their strict law are facing imprisonment, disappearance and potentially death. Despite what the Taliban promise, many believe that their rhetoric of modernisation is but empty words, or worse, the local leaders on the ground are ignoring the central authority.

The global reaction has been mostly negative - where the Western reaction (that of the US, UK and NATO allies) has been one of surprise and horror, with pledges made to strongly oppose the new administration. Signs coming from nations such as Russia, China and Pakistan have been more mixed - whilst they are unsettled by the great regional instability the regime change has caused, many security advisors in such member states see considerable advantage in the departure of NATO forces from Central Asia. However, very few nations are yet to pledge to work with a government that has a history of broken promises, extremism and vile human rights abuses. The issues therefore are profound: does the United Nations take the decision to work with a group that actively suppresses the rights of those who the UN was founded to protect, in order to prevent widespread famine and human catastrophe, or is a policy of isolation, strict sanctions and international condemnation required in order to get the new government to compromise on the issues of freedoms, equality and human rights?

## Points to Consider
- What is the opinion of your country with regards to the crisis?

- Will the Taliban bring stability or further chaos?

- Does the world community have a right to intervene in the domestic affairs of Afghanistan?

- Is it more important to protect the hard-won rights and freedoms of Afghanis or to prevent the impending humanitarian disaster through working with a distasteful administration?

- What policies would you propose (that could carry international support) in order to address these concerns?

- Are the Taliban the legitimate government of Afghanistan?
